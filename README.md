# Bootstrap TensorFlow GPU Practice

This project documents my first hands-on assignment with TensorFlow, focusing on environment setup, GPU testing in Google Colab, and basic logical operations using tensors. It forms the foundational block of my ML/DL coursework at Boston University.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- ✅ Setting up Conda environments with Python 3.11
- ✅ Installing TensorFlow 2.13
- ✅ Verifying GPU vs CPU execution using matrix ops
- ✅ Logical gates (AND, OR, NOT) with TensorFlow tensors
- ✅ Running notebooks in Jupyter and Google Colab

## 📄 File

- `bootstrap-tensorflow-gpu-practice.html`: Rendered version of the solution notebook, includes code and outputs.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3.11  
- TensorFlow 2.13  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Google Colab  
- Anaconda (Conda env)
